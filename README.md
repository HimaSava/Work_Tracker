# Work_Tracker
A program that keeps track of what you are doing.
Track how much time you spend on activities on your laptop!!!
You get the activity log and a end of the day log for doing further analysis on yourself ^_~

We no longer need big cooperations, we can do data-mining by ourself and on ourself's now!!!

## Setup

You can look at the code in the Work_Tracker.py file if you want to.

For others I have compiled a executable file. It is located in the /dist folder.

While using the .exe you need a csv called topics.csv in the same folder as the exe.
In the csv you can add what all topics you want to record.

## How it works

If you are using the exe simply run it. When you want to start, click on start the day and you are directed to a different screen. Here select the activity that you are starting and click start. The status for the activity changes to "In Progress" and it starts recording the time passed. Once done simply click the stop button and the activity is logged. 

Only one activity can be active at one time. I am not a supporter of multitasking. 

If you want to add new topics on the fly simply enter the name of the new topic in the entry box at the bottom and click add.

Once you are done for the day. Click on the End Day button. This button also generates a end of the day log that has all the topics and the amount of time spent on each one on it.  

You are done!

## LOGS

Currently the program has 2 kind of logs, an activity log and a day log.

#### Activity log

In this every time you start and end an activity an seperate entry is made. 

It records the name of the activity, date, start time, end time and the duration.

Note: If you end an activity and start the same again and end it again there will be seperate entries for the two activities


#### End of the Day log

This log records what all you did during the day.

It starts of with the date, start time and end time for the day.
Then it logs the total duration for each activity and the status of each activity at the end of the day.


Enjoy tracking your every move down to the second. §(*￣▽￣*)§
