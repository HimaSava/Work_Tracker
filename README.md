# Work_Tracker
A program that keeps track of what you are doing.

Track how much time you spend on doing what on your laptop!!!

You get the activity log and a end of the log for doing further analysis on yourself ^_~

We no longer need big cooperations, we can do data-mining on ourself now!!!

There are 2 versions, the main.py is a black/green UI and bw_main.py is a B/W UI. Otherwise the same.

Enjoy tracking your every move down to the second. §(*￣▽￣*)§
